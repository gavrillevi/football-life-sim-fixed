## üîß Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Update Asset System**
1. Add new animation assets to `src/assets/index.ts`
2. Update character sprite system to handle animations
3. Add CSS animations for sprite sheet cycling

### **Phase 2: Integrate Animations**
1. Update `SimsHomeScreen.tsx` to use different animations
2. Add animation state management
3. Implement smooth transitions between animations

### **Phase 3: Test and Refine**
1. Test all animations in game
2. Adjust timing and smoothness
3. Add animation transitions

## üìÅ File Structure
```
public/assets/sprites/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ anime-clean.png (current static character)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ anime-walk.png (4-frame walking animation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ anime-idle.png (2-4 frame breathing animation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ anime-train.png (4-frame training animation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ anime-sleep.png (2-frame sleeping animation)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ anime-eat.png (3-frame eating animation)
```

## üéØ Next Steps
1. Generate the animation sprite sheets using the prompts above
2. Update the asset system to load animations
3. Implement the animation system in the game
4. Test all animations and refine timing

## üí° Tips for Generation
- Use the same character design as anime-clean.png
- Ensure transparent backgrounds
- Keep movements smooth and natural
- Maintain consistent character proportions
- Test each animation individually before combining
