# 🚶‍♂️ Character Movement Fix - Priority System Implemented

## ✅ **Problem Fixed:**

### **❌ Before (Issue):**
- Character ignored new clicks while walking
- Had to wait for movement to complete before new clicks worked
- Poor user experience - clicks felt unresponsive
- Character would finish old movement before starting new one

### **✅ After (Fixed):**
- Latest click becomes new priority destination
- Character immediately changes direction to new location
- Smooth transitions between destinations
- Responsive control - no ignored clicks

---

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**

### **🎯 Key Changes:**

#### **1. Animation Tracking:**
```typescript
const [currentAnimation, setCurrentAnimation] = useState<number | null>(null)
```
- Track current animation ID
- Store animation reference for cancellation

#### **2. Animation Cancellation:**
```typescript
// Cancel any existing animation
if (currentAnimation) {
  cancelAnimationFrame(currentAnimation)
}
```
- Cancel existing movement before starting new one
- Prevents multiple animations running simultaneously

#### **3. Priority System:**
```typescript
// Move character to clicked location (will cancel any existing movement)
moveCharacterTo(targetX, targetY)
```
- New clicks immediately override old movement
- Latest click becomes new destination

#### **4. State Management:**
```typescript
const animationId = requestAnimationFrame(animate)
setCurrentAnimation(animationId)
```
- Properly track animation state
- Clean up animation references
