### 🏃 **Sports Items Moved Outside**

#### **❌ REMOVED from Home Interior:**
1. **🚫 Backyard Football Pitch** (was at `5, 70` - 40x25)
   - **Training**: Play with Friends → **Moved to STADIUM**
   - **Rationale**: Football needs outdoor space

2. **🚫 Juggling Area** (was at `60, 50` - 15x15)  
   - **Training**: Practice Juggling → **Moved to STADIUM**
   - **Rationale**: Juggling requires open space

#### **✅ CLEANED Home Interior:**
- **Only indoor activities remain**: Sleep, Watch Footage, Eat/Drink, Push-ups
- **Sports training moved**: All outdoor activities now at GYM/STADIUM
- **Logical separation**: Interior = relaxation, Exterior = physical training
