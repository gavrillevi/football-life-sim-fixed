## üõ†Ô∏è **Alternative Fix Prompts:**

### **Method 1: Emphasize Feet**
```
Create a 32x32 pixel art character sprite for a football player.

CRITICAL: Must have completely transparent background BUT solid, visible feet.

Character: Young male football player, blue jersey, white shorts, BLACK SHOES (must be solid and visible), brown hair, light skin.

Style: Kairosoft pixel art, standing pose with feet clearly visible.

Technical: 32x32 pixels, PNG with transparent background, FEET MUST BE OPAQUE AND VISIBLE.

Background: Transparent, but character's feet must be solid black shoes.
```

### **Method 2: Technical Focus**
```
Generate a 32x32 pixel art character sprite for a game:

Character: Football player (teenager, blue jersey, white shorts, black shoes, brown hair, light skin)
Style: Kairosoft pixel art
Technical: PNG format, alpha channel enabled, transparent background
Background: Alpha channel = 0 (completely transparent)
Output: Character sprite with no background elements

CRITICAL: Background must be transparent, but the character's feet/shoes must be solid and opaque.
FEET MUST BE VISIBLE - no transparent feet.
```

### **Method 3: Reference-Based**
```
Create a character sprite like Game Dev Story characters:

- 32x32 pixels
- Football player (blue jersey, white shorts, black shoes, brown hair, light skin)
- Kairosoft pixel art style
- PNG format with transparent background
- Character isolated on transparent background
- No background color or pattern

IMPORTANT: The character's feet must be solid and visible - like in Game Dev Story sprites where characters have solid feet.
```

## üö® **Troubleshooting Feet Issues:**

### **If Feet Are Still Transparent:**

1. **Try Different Phrasing:**
   - "Solid feet"
   - "Visible feet"
   - "Opaque feet"
   - "Feet must be solid"
   - "No transparent feet"

2. **Use Negative Instructions:**
   - "NO transparent feet"
   - "NO missing feet"
   - "NO invisible feet"
   - "Feet must be opaque"

3. **Technical Terms:**
   - "Feet alpha = 1"
   - "Solid feet"
   - "Opaque feet"
   - "Visible feet"

### **Alternative Approach:**
```
If you get transparent feet again:
1. Generate the character with a white background
2. Use an image editor to:
   - Select the white background
   - Delete it (make transparent)
   - BUT keep the feet solid
   - Save as PNG with transparency
```

## üìÅ **File Requirements:**

**Target File:** `character-idle.png`
**Location:** `public/assets/sprites/character-idle.png`
**Size:** 32x32 pixels
**Format:** PNG with transparent background
**Style:** Kairosoft pixel art
**CRITICAL:** Solid, visible feet

## üéØ **Success Criteria:**

The generated character should:
- [ ] Load properly in the game
- [ ] Have transparent background
- [ ] Be clearly visible at 64x64 pixels (scaled up)
- [ ] Look professional and game-ready
- [ ] Match the Kairosoft aesthetic
- [ ] **HAVE SOLID, VISIBLE FEET** (no transparency)
