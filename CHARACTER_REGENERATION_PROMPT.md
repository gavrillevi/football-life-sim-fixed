CRITICAL: Must have completely transparent background - NO white background, NO colored background, NO solid background.

Character: Teenage male, blue football jersey, white shorts, black shoes, short brown hair, standing pose.

Style: Kairosoft pixel art, clean design, transparent background, professional game asset.

Format: PNG with alpha channel, 32x32 pixels, transparent background, character isolated.

Background: Must be 100% transparent - no background color or pattern.
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Additional Techniques for Transparency:**

### **Method 1: Explicit Transparency Instructions**
```
Create a 32x32 pixel art character sprite with these requirements:

1. Character: Young football player in blue jersey, white shorts, black shoes
2. Style: Kairosoft pixel art
3. Background: COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT - no color, no pattern, no background
4. Format: PNG with alpha channel
5. Size: 32x32 pixels exactly

The background must be see-through/transparent - not white, not colored, not solid.
```

### **Method 2: Technical Specifications**
```
Generate a 32x32 pixel art character sprite for a game:

Character: Football player (teenager, blue jersey, white shorts, black shoes)
Style: Kairosoft pixel art
Technical: PNG format, alpha channel enabled, transparent background
Background: Alpha channel = 0 (completely transparent)
Output: Character sprite with no background elements

CRITICAL: Background must be transparent, not white or colored.
```

### **Method 3: Reference-Based**
```
Create a character sprite like Game Dev Story characters:

- 32x32 pixels
- Football player (blue jersey, white shorts, black shoes)
- Kairosoft pixel art style
- PNG format with transparent background
- Character isolated on transparent background
- No background color or pattern

The background should be completely transparent like in Game Dev Story sprites.
```

## üö® **Troubleshooting Transparency Issues:**

### **If Generator Still Creates White Background:**

1. **Try Different Phrasing:**
   - "Character on transparent background"
   - "Character with alpha channel"
   - "Character isolated on transparent background"
   - "Character sprite with no background"

2. **Use Negative Instructions:**
   - "NO white background"
   - "NO solid background"
   - "NO background color"
   - "Background must be transparent"

3. **Technical Terms:**
   - "Alpha channel enabled"
   - "Transparent PNG"
   - "RGBA format"
   - "Background alpha = 0"

### **Alternative Approaches:**

#### **Option 1: Generate with White Background, Then Remove**
```
Generate the character with a white background, then use an image editor to:
1. Select the white background
2. Delete it (make transparent)
3. Save as PNG with transparency
```

#### **Option 2: Use Different Generator Settings**
- Look for "transparency" or "alpha" options
- Enable "remove background" if available
- Use "PNG with alpha channel" format

#### **Option 3: Post-Processing**
```
If you get a white background:
1. Open in image editor (GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)
2. Select the white background
3. Delete it to make transparent
4. Save as PNG with transparency
```

## üìÅ **File Requirements:**

**Target File:** `character-idle.png`
**Location:** `public/assets/sprites/character-idle.png`
**Size:** 32x32 pixels
**Format:** PNG with transparent background
**Style:** Kairosoft pixel art

## üéÆ **Game Integration:**

Once generated, the character will be used as:
- **Idle state:** Static character sprite
- **Walking state:** Same sprite (will add walking animation later)
- **Training state:** Same sprite (will add training animation later)
- **Sleeping state:** Same sprite (will add sleeping animation later)

## ‚úÖ **Success Criteria:**

The generated character should:
- [ ] Load properly in the game
- [ ] Have transparent background
- [ ] Be clearly visible at 64x64 pixels (scaled up)
- [ ] Look professional and game-ready
- [ ] Match the Kairosoft aesthetic
- [ ] Be suitable for a football life simulation game

## üîÑ **Next Steps After Generation:**

1. **Test the new character** in the game
2. **Verify transparency** and visibility
3. **Generate walking animation** (4-frame sprite sheet)
4. **Generate other animations** (sleeping, training, eating)
5. **Add furniture sprites** (bed, TV, kitchen)

## üìù **Notes:**

- Start with a single static character
- We'll add animations later once the base character works
- Focus on quality and consistency with the game's aesthetic
- The character should look like a promising young football player
- Keep the design simple but appealing
